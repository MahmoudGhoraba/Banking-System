# Banking-System

My plan for my Banking System project in Java was that to let The system allow users to:

.Create a bank account
.Deposit and withdraw funds
.Check account balance
.Transfer money between accounts
.Exit the application

# Features 

Account Creation:
  Store user account details like account number, name, and balance.
  Assign unique account numbers automatically.
  
Deposit:
  Allow the user to deposit money into their account.
  Ensure only valid amounts (non-negative) are accepted.
  
Withdrawal:
  Allow the user to withdraw money from their account.
  Prevent withdrawal if insufficient funds are available.
  
Check Balance:
  Display the current balance of the userâ€™s account.
  
Transfer Funds:
  Allow money transfers between two accounts.
  Ensure both accounts exist and have enough balance for the transaction.
  
Exit:
  Allow users to exit the application gracefully, with all data saved.
